Local SEO means local search engine optimization. Local SEO as we may or may not know, has a more permanent ranking with organic search results indexed to give importance to certain sites within a given market. Google thus shows searchers which sites are more important based on how high up your website is listed in search engine results. The higher up, the more website traffic a company receives, and this in turn means more emails, phone calls, leads, and revenue.
